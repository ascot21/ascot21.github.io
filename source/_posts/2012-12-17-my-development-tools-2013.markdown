Every year more and more tools come out in the technology space.  In 2012,  I've adopted a ton of new tools into my web development workflow.   Here's a list of all of my tools, with the new ones in bold.

###Hardware

Now that I'm working more and more away from home my main development machine has become a 15 " Macbook Pro.  It's a 2GHz Intel Core i7 with 8Gb of RAM.  When I do work from home I prefer to work on 27" iMac.  I love the screen real estate and often wish I could bring it with me to the coffee shops I'm usually in.

I'm not big on using peripherals other than the standard keyboard and mouse.  I use several external harddrives to store my music, videos and backups.

###Software

Here are the top tools that I use every day.

***[Dropbox](http://dropbox.com/)*** - I use Dropbox for a variety of reasons.  It makes sharing files with other people incredibly easy.  I also use it to sync the preferences of several of my development apps across machines.  It's easy to set this up using [symbolic links](http://mattgeri.com/2012/01/symbolic-links-on-a-mac-os-x/).  I also use Dropbox to sync ebooks that I'm ready across my Macbook Pro, iPad and iPhone.

***[Sublime Text 2](http://www.sublimetext.com/)*** - Until this year, my go to text editor was Textmate.  While I still think Textmate is a good choice (especially now that it's open source), I think the features of Sublime Text set it apart.  I love how customizable it is and how many of the built-in features make you so much more productive.  And if it doesn't do something you'd like, there's probably a package that you can install to add in the feature.  Check out my [Sublime Preferences file](https://github.com/ascot21/SublimePrefs/blob/master/Preferences.sublime-settings).

***[Alfred](http://www.alfredapp.com/)*** - Alfred has become an essential part of how I work on my Mac.  I've mainly used it for launching apps and doing searches but I'm slowly learning how to use all of it's amazing features.

###Developer Tools

***[Git](http://git-scm.com/)*** and ***[Github](http://github.com)*** - Version control has always something I knew I needed but I never knew how to go about learning to use it.  Thanks to a few mentors I was able to learn it this year.  I've started implementing it for every project that I work on.  Not only does it make version control easy but it makes collaborating on a piece of software with other developers manageable.

***[iTerm](http://www.iterm2.com/#/section/home)*** - Learning how to use the Command Line was a big part of the new skills that I've learned this year.  While the built in Terminal application of Mac OS X is fine, I really love the features of iTerm.  This is the newest tool I've adopted so I'm still learning how to customize and use it to it's full potential.

***[Rubular](http://rubular.com/)*** - Great for writing and figuring out regular expressions.

***[Foundation](http://foundation.zurb.com/)*** - My preferred front-end framework of choice.  Similar to Twitter Bootstrap but I like the default design better.  I use it for building fully responsive sites but I also use it for quick prototyping.

***[Sass](http://sass-lang.com/)*** - I switched from using Less for precompiling CSS this year mainly because Sass is widely used in the Ruby community.

###User Tools

***[1Password ](https://agilebits.com/onepassword)***- Great for managing all of the passwords I use.  A must have from now on.

***[Trello](https://trello.com/)*** - Prior to this year I managed most of projects through very informal practices (ie. via email and written down to-do lists).  Now I'm using Trello to keep track of what I'm working on.  I also like that I can allow clients and collaborators to see what I'm working on and contribute if needed.

***[Freshbooks](http://freshbooks.com/)*** - Love how easy Freshbooks makes accounting.

***[Backblaze](http://www.backblaze.com/)*** - I've added online backup to my workflow.  In the past, I relied on external hard drives with Time Machine.  Backblaze makes this something I don't even think about.

***[Screenflow](http://www.telestream.net/screenflow/overview.htm)*** - I often record video walkthroughs of sites I build for clients so that they have a reference material on how to update their site.  Screenflow makes it easy to quickly record high quality videos.

***[LimeChat](http://limechat.net/mac/)*** - I've started hanging out in some developer focused IRC channels lately.  LimeChat is my preferred client.

***[Photoshop/Illustrator/InDesign](http://www.adobe.com/products/creativecloud.html)*** - I'm still using CS5 for all of my design tools.  Haven't had a reason to upgrade yet.

***[Rdio](http://www.rdio.com/)*** - In 2011, I started using streaming music to supplement my music collection.  In 2012, I've basically moved all of my collection to streaming music.  I've chosen Rdio because I love the great design of the app and the community features.

###What's Next

There are several tools that are on my list of things to learn about and hopefully start using in the coming months.  Here's a breakdown of the ones I plan on diving into soon.

***[Coffeescript](http://coffeescript.org/)*** - Should hopefully help make writing javascript quicker and easier.

***[Haml](http://haml.info/)*** - A HTML precompiler.

***[Backbone.js](http://backbonejs.org/)*** - An MVC javascript framework for the client side.
