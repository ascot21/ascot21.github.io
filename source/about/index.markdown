<p>I am a full-stack developer that specializes in working on custom web applications built with Ruby on Rails. I’m comfortable doing everything from managing a database, to styling a page with CSS, to writing heavy Javascript, to writing Rspec tests. I care about the quality of my code, the user experience and how my choices impact the business side of things. I’ve built a few mobile applications with the Phonegap platform that are in the iOS and Android stores.</p>

<p>I love helping other people learn to code. I spent several months teaching and mentoring future developers at the <a href="http://nashvillesoftwareschool.com">Nashville Software School</a>, a bootcamp style program.  I continue to help out as much as possible.</p>

<p>When I'm not coding I love spending time with my wife Samantha, traveling as much as possible, collecting records, homebrewing and crafting cocktails.  You can find me on <a href="http://instagram.com/ascot21">Instagram</a> and <a href="http://twitter.com/ascot21">Twitter</a>.</p>
